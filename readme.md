## Python from scratch:

### __init__.py
The __init__.py file is a special file in Python that serves multiple purposes. It is commonly found in directories that are intended to be treated as Python packages. Here are its main functions:
- Package Initialization: When a directory contains an __init__.py file, it signifies that the directory should be treated as a Python package. The file itself can be empty or can contain Python code. Its presence allows the directory to be imported as a module, and it initializes the package when it is imported.
- Symbolic Module: The __init__.py file can define symbols (variables, functions, classes) that will be available when the package is imported. These symbols can be accessed using the package name as the prefix. For example, if a package named "my_package" has an __init__.py file with a function named "my_function", it can be accessed as my_package.my_function.
